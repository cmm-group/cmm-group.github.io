        Surfin Workshop: Atomistic Insights into Processes at Mineral and Materials Surfaces and Interfaces
      </h2>
      <h3 style="font-weight: bold">Workshop Dates:</h3><p> Mon, 17 June 2019, 12:00 â€“ 17:00</p>
      <h3 style="font-weight: bold">Location:</h3><p>Joseph Priestley South Building, Room JP2/18, Department of Chemical Sciences, School of Applied Sciences,
      University of Huddersfield, Queensgate, Huddersfield, HD1 3DH (Building 24 on the map: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hud.ac.uk/media/assets/document/maps/CampusMap.pdf">https://www.hud.ac.uk/media/assets/document/maps/CampusMap.pdf</a>)</p>
      <h3 style="font-weight: bold">Workshop Description:</h3><p>The nanoscale characterization of minerals and materials surfaces and interfaces is key to the understanding and the control of interface processes,
      including adsorption, transport and reactivity. This will not only affect geochemical processes but also any industrial and technological applications that exploit these processes.
      This workshop aims to bring together the experimental and computational communities active in such research.
      Our aim is to promote combined approaches and interdisciplinary collaborations that span from experiments to modelling  and can provide atomistic details of the structures and processes at
      surfaces and interfaces to aid and rationalize their exploitation in environmental and technological applications.</p>

      <p>The meeting is free to attendees. It is open to all researchers working on surfaces and interfaces, independently of their application. Attendees are invited to submit an abstract.
        This is a great opportunity for PhD students at any stage of their PhD to present their research in a brief oral presentation in a relaxed environment,
        to discuss their research with senior researchers and fellow PhD students.</p>
